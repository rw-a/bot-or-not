# Bot Or Not
A web app party game where you try to determine who is actually an AI.

## Hosting
Note: this is currently not hosted anywhere due to high computational cost of running an LLM. You must self-host.

1. Install [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en)
2. Clone the repo
```
git clone https://github.com/rw-a/bot-or-not
```
3. Install the required dependencies
```
npm install
```
4. Start the server
```
npm run dev
```
5. Go to `http://localhost:5173` to open the game in your web browser. The port may differ if it was already taken; when you start the server, it will tell you which port to go to.

## How to Play

### Writing Phase:
You will be given a prompt. Your goal is to answer it, pretending to write your response like it was generated by an AI.

Hint: the AI used in this game is significantly less sophisticated than ChatGPT, so writing nonsensical responses is encouraged.

### Voting Phase:
You will be shown the responses that everyone else wrote PLUS the response written by the AI (but you don't know which one it is). Vote for the one you think was written by the AI.

### Scoring:
- You receive 500 points for making someone else vote for you.
- You receive 1000 points for voting for the response which was actually written by an AI.
